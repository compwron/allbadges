# allbadges

Generate a page that has all badges for your most recent gitub projects (non-setup badges will still show up, to remind you to set them up or possibly because I am lazy)

Usage:
```
ruby allbadges.rb <github username>
```

Expected output:
```
Wrote badge data to output/compwron_badges.json 
```
